# Project
Gammu is the name of the project as well as name of command line utility, which you can use to control your phone. It is written in C and built on top of [libGammu](https://wammu.eu/libgammu/).

Gammu command line utility provides access to wide range of phone features, however support level differs from phone to phone and you might want to check [Gammu Phone Database](https://wammu.eu/phones/) for user experiences with various phones. Generally following features are supported:

* Call listing, initiating and handling
* SMS retrieval, backup and sending
* MMS retrieval
* Phonebook listing, export and import (also from standard formats such as vCard)
* Calendar and tasks listing, export and import (also from standard formats such as vCalendar or iCalendar)
* Retrieval of phone and network information
* Access to phone file system (note that some phones work also as USB storage devices and those are not accessible through Gammu)

This project has originally forked from Gnokii and up to version 0.58 has been named MyGnokii2. Then need for better name arrived and Gammu was chosen as an acronym for Gammu All Mobile Management Utilities, without knowing that Gammu from the "Heretics of Dune" book written by Frank Herbert exists.

# Package specifics
* This Gammu package does not include just this binary, but as well [Gammu SMS Daemon](https://wammu.eu/smsd/) and [Gammu library](https://wammu.eu/libgammu/) (compiled with Visual Studio 2015 and compatible with newer versions) which you can use to develop own application accessing mobile phone.
* You can install the Gammu SMS Daemon as a Windows Service by creating a config file and running `gammu-smsd -i -c %path-to-the-config%`.
* All Gammu executables (including the Gammu SMS Daemon) are added to `PATH` for all users, no Desktop shortcut is created.

### Very quick start
Suppose you have a USB dongle which provides a COM port and you would like to make a USSD request.

First, check the Device Manager to find out the COM port under "Ports (COM &amp; LPT)".
Some HUAWEI modems provide COM ports, use the one called `3G PC UI Interface`.

Next, create the following `gammurc` file ([more details on configuration](https://docs.gammu.org/config/index.html)):

```
[gammu]
Device = com12:  # adjust COM port number here
```

Now run `gammu identify` to check connectivity with your SIM card and `gammu getussd "*100#"` to make an USSD request to `*100#`
